1. In folder *draft*, there is a note about the notion and training algorithm of restricted boltzmann machine(RBM).

2. In folder *code*, there is a simple implementation of the training process described in the note. This can be used to produce a plot similar to the Fig.4(b) in Giacomo Torlai and Roger G. Melko's work: [Learning Thermodynamics with Boltzmann Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02718v1)
