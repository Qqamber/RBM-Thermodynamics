## Files

1. In folder *draft*, there is a note about the notion and training algorithm of restricted boltzmann machine(RBM).

2. In folder *code*, there is a simple implementation of the training process described in the note. This can be used to produce a plot similar to the Fig.4(b) in Giacomo Torlai and Roger G. Melko's work: [Learning Thermodynamics with Boltzmann Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02718v1)

## Description
- `mc_sample.py`: generate spin configurations sampled from monte carlo simulation at different temperatures for Ising model on 2d square lattice;
- `rbm_train_sample.py`: use the data set generated by `mc_sample.py` to train RBM, and sample spin configurations from it;
- `plot.py`: visualization.
